---React.js/Bootstrap To-Do List Web Application by Konstantinos Antzoulidis---

Simple To-Do List web application. Users are able to add tasks by typing in the input field and pressing enter or clicking an "Add" button.
Each task has a checkbox to mark it as completed. Completed tasks have a visual indication (strike-through text, color change and "COMPLETED" text). 
Includes a button to delete the task as well as another button to clear all completed tasks at once.

-HTML for structuring the page.
-CSS/Bootstrap for styling the components.
-React-JavaScript for adding interactivity and managing the tasks
-Implemented local storage to persist tasks even if the user refreshes the page.
-Added animations and transitions for a smoother user experience.
-Made responsive for different screen sizes.

To run locally, clone repository and run the commands:
  - "npm -i" to install any missing depedencies
  - "npm start" to run on [localhost:](http://localhost:3000)

Following is the standard Bootstrap documentation.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
